​	-machine learning was developed as a new capability for computers

Examples:

​	-Database mining

​		Large datasets from growth of automation/web.

​		E.g., Web click data, medical records, Computational biology, engineering

​	-Applications can't program by hand.

​		E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of Natural Language Processing(NLP), Computer Vision.
