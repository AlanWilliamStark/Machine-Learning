Machine Learning definition

Arthur Samuel(1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell(1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

# Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the "right answers" were given.

To define with a bit more terminology this is also called a regression problem.

In supervised learning, in every example in our data set, we are told what is the "correct answer" that we would have quite liked the algorithms have predicted on that example.



# Unsupervised Learning

Given a data set with the same label or just without any label, an unsupervised learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in two different clusters. So this is called a clustering algorithm.
